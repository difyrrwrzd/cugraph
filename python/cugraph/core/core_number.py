def core_number(G):
    """
    Compute the core numbers for the nodes of the graph G.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph : cuGraph.Graph
        cuGraph graph descriptor with connectivity information. The graph can
        contain either directed or undirected edges where undirected edges are
        represented as directed edges in both directions.

    Returns
    -------
    df : cudf.DataFrame
        GPU data frame containing two cudf.Series of size V: the vertex
        identifiers and the corresponding core number values.

        df['vertex'] : cudf.Series
            Contains the vertex identifiers
        df['core_number'] : cudf.Series
            Contains the core number of vertices

    Examples
    --------
    >>> M = cudf.read_csv('datasets/karate.csv', delimiter=' ',
    >>>                   dtype=['int32', 'int32', 'float32'], header=None)
    >>> sources = cudf.Series(M['0'])
    >>> destinations = cudf.Series(M['1'])
    >>> G = cugraph.Graph()
    >>> G.add_edge_list(sources, destinations, None)
    >>> cn = cugraph.core_number(G)
    """

    df = core_number_wrapper.core_number(G.graph_ptr)
